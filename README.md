## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis process using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Tableau to extract valuable insights from a dataset. The process includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to guide decision-making and enhance data representation.

## Data Analysis Process

### Data Cleaning and Analyzing with SSMS

1. **Leveraging Window Functions:**
   - Utilized functions such as `ROW_NUMBER` and aggregate functions like `SUM` and `COUNT` to clean and analyze the dataset.
   - Removed duplicate data, converted column data types, and ensured data integrity.

2. **Exploring Patterns and Trends:**
   - Used SQL queries to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
   - Aggregated metrics such as sales and customer segments.

3. **Actionable Insights:**
   - Derived insights to guide decision-making based on the aggregated data.

### Tableau Visualization

1. **Creating Intuitive Visualizations:**
   - Developed interactive dashboards to provide a clear overview of sales performance, customer behavior, and product insights.

2. **Sales Performance Across Different Countries:**
   - The world map visualization highlights sales performance across various countries.
     - Darker shades indicate higher sales.
     - Lighter or unshaded areas represent lower or no sales.
   - **Notable Observations:**
     - Sales are concentrated in specific regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe).
     - Some countries have minimal or no sales data (e.g., parts of Africa, Central Asia).

3. **Monthly Sales Trends:**
   - The line graph displays monthly sales over a year.
     - **Key Observations:**
       - Sales exhibit a consistent upward trend.
       - Significant surge in sales around October or November, possibly due to holidays, promotions, or other factors.

4. **Customer Segments:**
   - The bar graph shows purchase counts based on customer segments.
     - **Noteworthy Points:**
       - The "Frequent" customer segment has the highest purchase count.
       - "Low-Value on Air" customers also contribute significantly.
       - High-value segments (e.g., "High-Value," "High-Value on Air") have comparatively lower purchase counts.

5. **Top 5 Most Sold Products:**
   - The pie chart illustrates the distribution of sales among the top 5 products.
     - **Observations:**
       - The 50's Christmas gift bag large dominates sales.
       - Other products have relatively smaller shares.

6. **Customer Retention Analysis:**
   - Textual information provides key metrics:
     - **Average Retention Rate:** 64%
     - **Churned Customers:** 3,122
     - **Retained Customers:** 5,635
     - **Total Customers:** 8,757

## Recommendations

1. **Expand Market Reach:**
   - Target countries with low sales.
   - Explore new markets and establish partnerships.
   - Invest in localized marketing efforts.

2. **Optimize Year-End Strategies:**
   - Leverage the year-end sales trend.
   - Plan promotions, discounts, or product launches accordingly.

3. **Segment-Specific Marketing:**
   - Tailor marketing campaigns to different customer segments.
   - Retain high-value customers and engage low-value frequent customers.

## Market and Financial Analysis

1. **Market Gap:**
   - Few, if any, products on the market help customers like we do.

2. **Customer Spending:**
   - 66% of US consumers spend money on multiple products that only partially resolve their issue.

3. **Financials:**
   - Millennials account for about a quarter of the $48 billion spent on other products in 2018.

4. **Costs:**
   - Loss of productivity costs consumers thousands of dollars.

5. **Usability:**
   - Customers want something easy to use that helps make their life easier.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of combining SQL Server Management Studio for data analysis and Tableau for visualization to derive actionable insights and guide business decisions. The insights and recommendations provided aim to enhance sales strategies, market reach, and customer engagement.
